# Contribution Guide

The Spiral Framework is an open-source project that relies on the contributions of developers from around the world to improve and maintain the framework.
If you are interested in contributing to the Spiral Framework, there are many ways that you can get involved and help make the framework even better.

One way to contribute to the framework is by submitting pull requests on GitHub.
If you have a fix or improvement, you can submit a [pull request](https://github.com/spiral/framework/pulls) and it will be reviewed by the maintainers.
There are a few requirements that you should be aware of when making a pull request:

- **Keep it simple:** This means that we prefer simple solutions over complex ones. When making a pull request, try to keep your code as simple and straightforward as possible.

- **Follow the PSR-12 coding standard:** This means that your code should be formatted and structured in a way that is consistent with the [PSR-12](https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-12/) standard.

- **Declare strict types:** The framework requires that all PHP files declare [strict types](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.types.declarations.php#language.types.declarations.strict) using the `declare(strict_types=1);` directive at the top of the file. This helps ensure that code is type-safe and reduces the risk of bugs and errors.

- **Include tests:** It is important to include tests with your pull request to ensure that the code you are submitting is working as intended. This helps the Spiral Framework maintainers verify that your code is correct and does not introduce any new issues.

- **Use Psalm**: [Psalm](https://psalm.dev/) is a static analysis tool that helps identify issues in your code. The Spiral Framework requires that all code submitted be checked with Psalm to ensure that it is correct and follows best practices.

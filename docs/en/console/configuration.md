# Console - Installation and Configuration

All of the provided application skeletons include the Console component by default. To enable component in alternative
builds make sure to require composer package `spiral/console` and modify the application bootloader:

```php
[
    //...
    Spiral\Bootloader\CommandBootloader::class,
]
```

Make sure to include this bootloader at last, as it will also activate the set of default commands for previously added
components.

To invoke application command run:

```bash
php app.php command:name
```

To get a list of available commands:

```bash
php app.php
```

To get help about the particular command:

```bash
php app.php help command:name
```

## Invoke in Application

You can invoke console commands inside your application or application tests. This approach can be useful to create mock
data for tests or automatically pre-configure the database.

Use `Spiral\Console\Console` to do that:

```php
use Spiral\Console\Console;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Input\ArrayInput;
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\BufferedOutput;

// ...

public function test(Console $console)
{
    $input = new ArrayInput(['args' => 'value']);
    $output = new BufferedOutput();
    
    return $console->run($command, $input, $output);
}
```

## Symfony/Console

Spiral Console dispatcher built at the top of
powerful [Symfony Console](http://symfony.com/doc/current/components/console/introduction.html) component.

> You can register native Symfony Commands in your CLI application.

## Configuration

To apply the custom configuration to the Console component use `Spiral\Config\ConfiguratorInterface` or create a config
file in `app/config/console.php`:

```php
return [
     // application name
     'name'      => null,
     
     // application version
     'version'   => null,
     
     // list of application commands (if auto-discover disabled)
     'commands'  => [],
     
     // list of commands and sequences to run in `app configure`
     'configure' => [],
     
     // list of commands and sequences to run in `app update`
     'update'    => []
];
```

You can modify some of these values during application bootload via `Spiral\Bootloader\ConsoleBootloader`. To register
new user command:

```php
public function boot(ConsoleBootloader $console)
{
    $console->addCommand(MyCommand::class);
}
```

> Note, by default Console component use auto-discovery mode to find all user commands in `app/` automatically.

To register command in configure/update sequence:

```php
public function boot(ConsoleBootloader $console)
{
  $console->addUpdateSequence('my:command', '<info>Running my:command...</info>');
}
```

## Connection with RoadRunner

Please note, console commands invoked outside of the RoadRunner server. Make sure to run an instance of application
server if any of your commands must communicate with it.

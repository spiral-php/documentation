# Console - Sequences

The Spiral Framework provides a way to group together and execute a series of console commands or closures in a specific
order. These groups of commands and closures are called "sequences", and there are two types: `configure` and
`update` sequences.

Using console sequences can be a convenient way to automate common tasks or operations in your application, and can help
to ensure that they are performed consistently and in the correct order.

## Command registration

### Configure Sequences

Configure sequences are intended to be used for tasks related to setting up or configuring an application. These
commands
are run after the `php app.php configure` command is invoked.

Here is an example of a configure sequence:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Spiral\Boot\Bootloader\Bootloader;
use Spiral\Console\Bootloader\ConsoleBootloader;

class AppBootloader extends Bootloader
{
    public function boot(ConsoleBootloader $console): void
    {
        $console->addConfigureSequence(
            sequence: 'generate:keys', 
            header: '<info>Generating SSH keys for the application...</info>'
        );
        
        // Add closure in a sequence
        // It supports auto-wiring of arguments
        $console->addConfigureSequence(
            static function(OutputInterface $output, ContainerInterface $container): void {
                // do something
            }, 
            '<info>Caching something...</info>'
        );
    }
}
```

### Update Sequences

Update sequences are intended to be used for tasks related to updating or modifying an application. These commands
are run after the `php app.php update` command is invoked.

Here is an example of an update sequence:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Spiral\Boot\Bootloader\Bootloader;
use Spiral\Console\Bootloader\ConsoleBootloader;

class AppBootloader extends Bootloader
{
    public function boot(ConsoleBootloader $console): void
    {
        $console->addUpdateSequence('db:migrate', '<info>Database migration...</info>');
        
        // Add closure in a sequence
        // It supports auto-wiring of arguments
        $console->addConfigureSequence(
            static function(OutputInterface $output, ContainerInterface $container): void {
                // do something
            }, 
            '<info>Caching something...</info>'
        );
    }
}
```

## Custom sequences

In addition to these predefined sequences, the Spiral Framework also allows you to create custom sequences. Custom
console sequences are groups of console commands or closures that are intended to be run in a specific order, and are
created and managed by the user.

Here is an example of an update sequence:

```php
use Symfony\Component\Console\Output\OutputInterface;
use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Spiral\Boot\Bootloader\Bootloader;
use Spiral\Console\Bootloader\ConsoleBootloader;

class AppBootloader extends Bootloader
{
    public function boot(ConsoleBootloader $console): void
    {
        $console->addSequence(
            name: 'cache_everything', 
            sequence: 'route:cache',
            header: '<info>Route caching...</info>',
            footer: '<info>Route caching completed.</info>'
        );
         
        $console->addSequence(
            name: 'cache_everything', 
            sequence: 'config:cache',
            header: '<info>Config caching...</info>',
            footer: '<info>Config caching completed.</info>'
        );
        
        // ... 
    }
}
```

Custom sequences can be run from a console command that extends the `Spiral\Console\Sequence\SequenceCommand` class.

Here is an example of a custom sequence command:

```php
namespace App\Command;

use Psr\Container\ContainerInterface;
use Spiral\Console\Config\ConsoleConfig;

final class CacheEverythingCommand extends SequenceCommand
{
    protected const NAME = 'cache:everything';
    protected const DESCRIPTION = 'Cache everything in the project';

    public function perform(ConsoleConfig $config, ContainerInterface $container): int
    {
        $this->info('Caching everything in the project...');
        $this->newLine();

        return $this->runSequence($config->getSequence('cache_everything'), $container);
    }
}
```

Custom sequences can be a useful tool for automating tasks or operations in your application, and can help to streamline
your development and maintenance processes.

## Sequence execution

Once you have added your commands and closures to a sequence, you can execute the sequence using the
`php app.php configure` command for the configure sequence or the `php app.php update` command for the update sequence.
The console will display the description of each command or closure as it is run, along with any output generated by the
command or closure.

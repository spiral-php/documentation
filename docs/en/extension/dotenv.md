# Extensions - Dotenv
Default application skeleton includes the ability to read ENV values from `.env` file located in the root of the project.

## Configuration
To install Dotenv extension in non-default application skeleton:

```bash
composer require spiral/dotenv-bridge
```

Add the following bootloader to your application:

```php
    protected const LOAD = [
        Spiral\DotEnv\Bootloader\DotenvBootloader::class,
        
        //...
    ]
```

> Make sure to add a bootloader at the top of the list to alter Env.

The values from the `.env` the file will be copied into your env and available via `Spiral\Boot\EnvironmentInterface` or `env` function.

> Attention, this component overwrites system ENV values.

## Pre-Processing
Please remember that values in `.env` will be pre-processed, following changes will occure:

Value | PHP Value
--- | ---
true   | true,
(true) | true,
false  | false,
(false)| false,
null   | null,
(null) | null,
empty  | ''

> The quotes around strings will be stripped automatically.

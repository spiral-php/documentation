# HTTP - Cookies

The default application skeleton enables cookie integration by default.

If you need to enable cookies it in alternative builds, require composer package `spiral/cookies` and add
bootloader `Spiral\Bootloader\Http\CookiesBootloader` into your app.

## Cookie Manager

The easiest way to manage cookies in Spiral is to obtain an instance of `Spiral\Cookies\CookieManager`. This instance
can be stored inside singleton services and controllers and provide access to active request scope.

```php
public function index(CookieManager $cookies): void
{
    dump($cookies->getAll());
    $cookies->set('name', 'value'); // read about more options down below
}
```

If you use `spiral/prototype` extension, you can also access `CookieManager` using `cookies` prototype property:

```php
use PrototypeTrait;

public function index(): void
{
    dump($this->cookies->getAll());
    $this->cookies->set('name', 'value'); // read about more options down below
}
```

Read more about low-level cookie management down below.

## Read Cookie

By default, the framework will encrypt and decrypt all cookies values using ENV key `ENCRYPTER_KEY`. Changing this value
will automatically invalidate all cookie values set for all users.

> **Note**
> You can also disable encryption for performance reasons or use alternative HMAC signature method (see below).

Cookie component will decrypt all values and update the request object, so you can get all cookies values using default
PSR-7 `ServerRequestInterface`:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

// ...

public function index(ServerRequestInterface $request): void
{
    dump($request->getCookieParams());
}
```

Alternatively, you can read cookie values using `Spiral\Http\Request\InputManager` which automatically resolves the
request scope and can be referenced as a singleton:

```php
class HomeController
{
    private $input;

    public function __construct(InputManager $input)
    {
        $this->input = $input;
    }

    public function index(): void
    {
        dump($this->input->cookies->all());
    }
}
```

> **Note**
> You can also request cookie value in request filters.

Note, if the cookie value is invalid and or can't be decrypted, its value will be set to NULL and not available to the
application.

## Write Cookie

Since all of the cookie values must be encrypted or signed, you must use the proper way to write them.
Use context-specific object `Spiral\Cookies\CookieQuery`.

```php
public function index(CookieQuery $cookies): void
{
    $cookies->set('name', 'value');
}
```

The method accepts the following arguments in the same order:

| Parameter | Type   | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
|-----------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Name      | string | The name of the cookie.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| Value     | string | The value of the cookie. This value stored on the client's computer; do not store sensitive information.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| Lifetime  | int    | Cookie lifetime. This value specified in seconds and declares a period in which cookie will expire relatively to the current time().                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| Path      | string | The path on the server in which the cookie will be available. If set to '/', the cookie will be available within the entire domain. If set to '/foo/', the cookie will only be available within the /foo/ directory and all sub-directories such as /foo/bar/ of the domain. The default value is the current directory that the cookie is being set in. |
| Domain    | string | The domain that the cookie is available. To make the cookie available on all subdomains of example.com, then you'd set it to '.example.com'. The . is not required but makes it compatible with more browsers. Setting it to www.example.com will make the cookie only available in the www subdomain. Refer to tail matching in the spec for details.   |
| Secure    | bool   | Indicates that the cookie should only be transmitted over a secure HTTPS connection from the client. When set to true, the cookie will only set if a secure connection exists. On the server-side, it's on the programmer to send this kind of cookie only on a secure connection (e.g., for $_SERVER["HTTPS"]).                                         |
| HttpOnly  | bool   | When true, the cookie will be made accessible only through the HTTP protocol. This flag means that the cookie won't be available by scripting languages, such as JavaScript. This setting can effectively help to reduce identity theft through XSS attacks (although, not all browsers support it).                                                     |

> **Note**
> Same arguments for `Spiral\Cookies\CookieManager`->`set`.

## Usage with Singletons

You can not use `CookieQuery` as `__construct` argument. Queue is only available within IoC context of CookieMiddleware
and must be requested from container directly (use method injection as showed above):

```php
$container->get(CookieQuery::class)->set($name, $value);
```

> **Note**
> The best place to use `CookieQuery` is controller methods.

If you already have access to `ServerRequestInterface` use can also use attribute `cookieQueue`:

```php
use Psr\Http\Message\ServerRequestInterface;

// ...

public function index(ServerRequestInterface $request): void
{
    $request->getAttribute('cookieQueue')->set('name', 'value');
}
```

## Set Cookie Manually

You can always write cookie header manually by invoking `withAddedHeader` of `Psr\Http\Message\ResponseInterface`:

```php
return $response->withAddedHeader('Set-Cookie', 'name=value');
```

> Make sure to add a cookie to whitelist, otherwise, CookieMiddleware won't let it pass.

## Configuration

You can configure `CookieQueue` behavior using `Spiral\Bootloader\Http\CookiesBootloader`.

To whitelist cookie (disable protection) in your bootloader:

```php
public function boot(CookiesBootloader $cookies): void
{
    $cookies->whitelistCookie('CustomCookie');
}
```

To perform deeper configuration on cookie component create config file `cookies.php` in `app/config` directory:

```php
<?php
declare(strict_types=1);

use Spiral\Cookies\Config\CookiesConfig;

return [
    // by default all cookies will be set as .domain.com
    'domain'   => '.%s',

    // protection method
    'method'   => CookiesConfig::COOKIE_ENCRYPT,

    // whitelisted cookies (no encrypt/decrypt)
    'excluded' => ['PHPSESSID', 'csrf-token']
];
```

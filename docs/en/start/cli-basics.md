# Getting started â€” First CLI command

Spiral provides convenient way to create console applications. It has the built-in support for console
commands, which allows you to create command-line interfaces (CLIs) for your application. With console commands, you can
automate tasks, perform maintenance, and interact with your application in a way that is not possible with a standard
web interface.

Managing and using console commands in Spiral is very easy. The framework provides a convenient interface
for working with console commands by leveraging the power of the `symfony/console` package.

Here are the basic steps to creating a console command in Spiral:

## Creating a command

Here's an example of a basic console command that outputs current date to the console:

```php app/src/App/Endpoint/Console/CurrentDateCommand.php
namespace App\Endpoint\Console;

use Spiral\Console\Command;

final class CurrentDateCommand extends Command
{
    protected const SIGNATURE = 'current:date {format=Y-m-d : Date format}';
    protected const DESCRIPTION = 'Get current date';

    public function __invoke(): void
    {
        $this->writeln(\date($this->argument('format')));
    }
}
```

Spiral is configured by default to automatically discover commands located in the `app/src` directory
using the [static analysis component](../advanced/tokenizer.md). This means that you don't have to manually register
your commands or create a separate configuration file for them.

## Running the command

To get help information for your command, you can run the followed command in your terminal.

```terminal
php app.php help current:date
```

This will display the command's signature, description, and any available arguments or options.

```output
[33mDescription:[39m
  Get current date

[33mUsage:[39m
  current:date [<format>]

[33mArguments:[39m
  [32mformat[39m                Date format[33m [default: "Y-m-d"][39m

[33mOptions:[39m
  [32m-h, --help[39m            Display help for the given command. When no command is given display help for the [32mlist[39m command
  [32m-q, --quiet[39m           Do not output any message
  [32m-V, --version[39m         Display this application version
  [32m    --ansi|--no-ansi[39m  Force (or disable --no-ansi) ANSI output
  [32m-n, --no-interaction[39m  Do not ask any interactive question
  [32m-v|vv|vvv, --verbose[39m  Increase the verbosity of messages: 1 for normal output, 2 for more verbose output and 3 for debug
```

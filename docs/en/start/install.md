# Installation
You can install Spiral components independently or use a pre-build application skeleton, which enables most of the framework functions. You can either downgrade Web skeleton or use the CLI skeleton with minimal number dependencies to start a new application.

Default Web (full-stack) skeleton is available on https://github.com/spiral/app

Installation includes a customized version of the RoadRunner application server with additional extensions and framework-specific functions enabled.
<br/>

Server Requirements
--------
Make sure that your server configured with the following PHP version and extensions:
* PHP 8.0+, 64bit
* *mb-string* extension (spiral is UTF-8 centric framework)
* PDO Extension with desired database drivers

* High-performance HTTP, HTTP/2 server based on [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev)

Installation

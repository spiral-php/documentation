# Getting started — Long running

Spiral designed to facilitate the development of long-running applications while ensuring efficient memory
management and the prevention of memory leaks. This is achieved through the utilization of
advanced [memory management techniques](../framework/scopes.md). Additionally, it is paired with RoadRunner, further
enhancing the overall performance and scalability of the application.

RoadRunner is a high-performance PHP application server and process manager that enables long-running capabilities for
PHP applications. It provides efficient resource management, such as CPU and memory usage, which helps to keep the
application running smoothly and efficiently over an extended period of time.

It designed to handle a wide range of request types, including [HTTP](../http/lifecycle.md),
[gRPC](../grpc/configuration.md), TCP, [Queue Job](../queue/roadrunner.md) consuming, and Temporal. It operates by
running workers only once when it is initiated and then directing requests to a [dispatcher](../framework/dispatcher.md)
based on their type. This means that each worker is isolated and works independently, following a "share nothing"
approach where resources are not shared between workers.

Using RoadRunner can significantly improve the speed and efficiency by eliminating the need for the application to go
through the bootstrapping process repeatedly. This can save on CPU and memory resources and reduce response time.

## Installation

Using RoadRunner is relatively simple. Once you have downloaded the binary file, you can use it to run your PHP
application.

There are several ways to download it:

:::: tabs

::: tab Composer

The best way is to use composer package `spiral/roadrunner-cli`. It will help you to download the server
automatically.

Just install the package in your project and run the following command:

```terminal
composer require spiral/roadrunner-cli
```

And run the following command to download the latest version of the RoadRunner:

```terminal
./vendor/bin/rr get
```

> **Warning**
> PHP's extensions `php-curl` and `php-zip` are required to download RoadRunner automatically.
:::

::: tab cURL

Download the latest stable release of RoadRunner with cURL.

```bash
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/master/download-latest.sh | sh
```
:::

::: tab Docker

RoadRunner provides pre-compiled RoadRunner server binaries within a Docker image.

```docker Dockerfile
FROM spiralscout/roadrunner as roadrunner
# OR
# FROM ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner as roadrunner

FROM php:8.1-cli

# Copy the RoadRunner binary from the roadrunner image to the local bin directory
COPY --from=roadrunner /usr/bin/rr /usr/local/bin/rr

# Run the RoadRunner server command
CMD ["rr", "serve"]
```

**The image is available on:**

- **Github** — [ghcr.io/roadrunner-server/roadrunner](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/pkgs/container/roadrunner)
- **Docker Hub** — [spiralscout/roadrunner](https://hub.docker.com/r/spiralscout/roadrunner)

:::

::: tab Linux
Installation option for the Debian-derivatives (Ubuntu, Mint, MX, etc)

```bash
wget https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases/download/v2.X.X/roadrunner-2.X.X-linux-amd64.deb
sudo dpkg -i roadrunner-2.X.X-linux-amd64.deb
```
:::

::: tab Github

If none of the other installation options work for you, you can always download RoadRunner binary directly on GitHub.

Go to the [latest RoadRunner release](https://github.com/roadrunner-server/roadrunner/releases/latest), scroll down to 
"Assets", and select the binary corresponding to your operating system.

## Configuration

You can configure the number of workers, memory limits, and other plugins using `.rr.yaml` file:

```yaml .rr.yaml
rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php app.php"
  relay: pipes

# HTTP plugin settings
http:
  address: 0.0.0.0:8080
  middleware: [ "gzip", "static" ]
  static:
    dir: "public"
    forbid: [ ".php", ".htaccess" ]
  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    supervisor:
      max_worker_memory: 100
```

To set the number of workers for HTTP:

```yaml .rr.yaml
http:
  pool:
    num_workers: 4
```

> **See more**
> Read more about application server configuration in the official [documentation](https://roadrunner.dev/docs).

## Running the Server

:::: tabs

::: tab Linux

Use the following command to start application server on **Linux**

```terminal
./rr serve
```

> **Warning**
> Make sure that `rr` binary is executable.

:::

::: tab Windows
Use the following command to start application server on **Windows**

```terminal
./rr.exe serve
```

## RoadRunner bridge

The [spiral/roadrunner-bridge](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-bridge) package provides full integration between
Spiral and RoadRunner. This package allows developers to use RoadRunner's various plugins,
including `http`, `grpc`, `jobs`, `tcp`, `kv`, `centrifugo`, `logger`, and `metrics`.

> **Note**
> The component is available by default in the [application bundle](https://github.com/spiral/app).

### Installation

To install the package, run the following command:

```terminal
composer require spiral/roadrunner-bridge
```

Once installed, you need to add the package's bootloaders to your application in the `Kernel`, choosing the specific
bootloaders that correspond to the plugins you want to use:

```php app/src/Application/Kernel.php
use Spiral\RoadRunnerBridge\Bootloader as RoadRunnerBridge;

protected const LOAD = [
    RoadRunnerBridge\HttpBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with http plugin
    RoadRunnerBridge\QueueBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with jobs plugin
    RoadRunnerBridge\CacheBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with KV plugin
    RoadRunnerBridge\GRPCBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with GRPC plugin
    RoadRunnerBridge\BroadcastingBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with broadcasting plugin
    RoadRunnerBridge\CommandBootloader::class,
    RoadRunnerBridge\TcpBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with TCP plugin
    RoadRunnerBridge\MetricsBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with metrics plugin
    RoadRunnerBridge\LoggerBootloader::class, // Optional, if it needs to work with app-logger plugin
    // ...
];
```

## Beware of the Underwater Rocks

There are a few limitations to be aware of when using long-running applications.

### Application State

When running your application using RoadRunner server, any changes in files will not affect your application because
after start it is loaded into memory. To see changes, you need to restart the server. This could lead to some
inconvenience.

To force worker reload after every request (full debug mode) and limit processing to a single worker, add a `debug`
option. This can be useful for debugging and development purposes.

```yaml .rr.yaml
http:
  pool:
    debug: true
```

Another option for development is the Auto-Reloading feature of RoadRunner, which can automatically detect PHP file
changes and reload workers. The reload component can be configured by modifying the reload section in the `.rr.yaml`
file.

```yaml .rr.yaml
reload:
  # sync interval
  interval: 1s
  # global patterns to sync
  patterns: [ ".php" ]
  # list of included for sync services
  services:
    http:
      # recursive search for file patterns to add
      recursive: true
      # ignored folders
      ignore: [ "vendor" ]
      # service specific file pattens to sync
      patterns: [ ".php", ".go", ".md" ]
      # directories to sync. If recursive is set to true,
      # recursive sync will be applied only to the directories in `dirs` section
      dirs: [ "." ]
```

> **Warning**
> It's important to note that the reload component can affect the performance of the application server, so it's best to
> use it in development mode only.

### Memory Leaks

As the application stays in memory for a long time, even a small memory leak could lead to the process restart.
RoadRunner monitors memory consumption and performs a soft reset, but it's best to avoid memory leaks in your
application source code.

> **Note**
> Framework includes a set of instruments to simplify the development process and avoid memory/state leaks such as
> IoC Scopes, Cycle ORM, Immutable Configs, Domain Cores, Routes, and Middleware.

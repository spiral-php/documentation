# Application Lifecycle

Spiral Framework can work using classic Nginx/PHP-FPM setup. But the highest effectiveness can be achieved using an
embedded application server (based on [RoadRunner](https://roadrunner.dev/)). The server creates a set of php processes
for each dispatching/communication method (HTTP, GRPC, Queue, TCP, etc.).

Every PHP process will only work within a single request/task. It allows you to write code as if you would typically do
in classic frameworks (share nothing approach). You can also use every library as in the past with only minor
exceptions.

> flow [here](/http/lifecycle.md).

## Application Server

The RoadRunner Application Server is installed using the [RoadRunner Bridge](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-bridge) 
integration package. In the [spiral/app](https://github.com/spiral/app) skeleton, this package is already installed and
configured.

> **Note**
> Learn more about the [RoadRunner Bridge](https://spiral.dev/docs/packages-roadrunner-bridge):

You can configure the number of workers, memory limits, and other extensions using `.rr.yaml` file:

```yaml
version: '2.7'

rpc:
  listen: tcp://127.0.0.1:6001

server:
  command: "php app.php"
  relay: pipes

# serve static files
static:
  dir: "public"

# HTTP plugin settings
http:
  address: 0.0.0.0:8080
  middleware: [ "gzip", "static" ]
  static:
    dir: "public"
    forbid: [ ".php", ".htaccess" ]
  pool:
    num_workers: 2
    supervisor:
      max_worker_memory: 100
```

To set the number of workers for HTTP:

```yaml
http:
  pool:
    num_workers: 4
```

### Developer Mode
To force worker reload after every request (full debug mode) and limit processing to single worker, add a `debug` option:

```yaml
http:
  pool:
      debug: true
```

You can read more about RoadRunner [here](https://roadrunner.dev/docs).

## Application Kernel

Every worker will contain a single application instance. Default application skeleton(s) are based
on [spiral/boot](https://github.com/spiral/boot).

The package allows quick application instantiation via static factory method `create` and run the created application via the `run` method:

```php
$app = \App\App::create(['root' => __DIR__])->run();
```

Application Kernel initiates your application state and IoC configuration using a set of bootloaders:

```php
class App extends Kernel
{
    /*
     * List of components and extensions to be automatically registered
     * within system container on application start.
     */
    protected const LOAD = [
        // Environment configuration
        DotEnv\DotenvBootloader::class,
        
        // Core Services
        Bootloader\DebugBootloader::class,
        Bootloader\SnapshotsBootloader::class,
        Bootloader\I18nBootloader::class,
        
        // Security and validation
        Bootloader\Security\EncrypterBootloader::class,
        
        // ...
    ];
}
```

The bootloaders will only be invoked once, without request/task context after that application will stay in the process
memory permanently. Since the application bootload only happens once for many requests, you can add many components and
extensions without the performance penalty (still, watch the memory consumption).

## Gotchas

There are a couple of limitations to be aware of.

#### Memory Leaks

Since the application stays in memory for a long time, even a small memory leak might lead to the process restart.
RoadRunner will monitor memory consumption and perform a soft reset, but it is best to avoid memory leaks in your 
application source code.

Though Framework and all of its components are written with memory management in mind, you still have to make sure that
your domain code is not leaking.

#### Application State

> **Note**
> Framework includes a set of instruments to simplify the development process and avoid memory/state leaks such as 
> IoC Scopes, Cycle ORM, Immutable Configs, Domain Cores, Routes, and Middleware.

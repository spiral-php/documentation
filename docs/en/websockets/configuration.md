# Installation and Configuration

One of the key features of the Spiral Framework is its integration with
the [Centrifugo WebSocket server](https://centrifugal.dev/). This integration is facilitated by the
RoadRunner [centrifuge plugin](https://roadrunner.dev/docs/plugins-centrifuge), which uses the
Centrifugo [Server GRPC API](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/server_api#grpc-api) to establish communication between
RoadRunner and the Centrifugo web server.

With this integration, you can send events to WebSocket clients as well as receive events from the Centrifugo server.

Here are events that can be received as part of this integration:

- [**Connection requests:**](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#connect-proxy) When a client establishes a
  WebSocket connection to the Centrifugo server, a connection request event is sent to RoadRunner.
- [**Refresh connection events:**](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#refresh-proxy) Centrifugo sends a refresh
  event to RoadRunner when it is time to refresh the connection between the client and the server.
- [**RPC calls:**](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#rpc-proxy) Centrifugo can send RPC (Remote Procedure Call)
  events to RoadRunner over a client connection. These events allow you to invoke server-side functions from the client.
- [**Subscribe requests:**](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#subscribe-proxy) When a client subscribes to a
  channel, Centrifugo sends a subscribe request event to RoadRunner.
- [**Publish calls:**](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#publish-proxy) This request happens **BEFORE** a
  message is published to a channel, so your backend can validate whether a client can publish data to a channel.

Spiral Framework and Centrifugo provide a powerful and flexible toolset for developers looking to build scalable,
high-quality applications that require efficient management of real-time data transmission.

## Installation

To install the Centrifuge plugin, you must first
install [spiral/roadrunner-bridge](https://github.com/spiral/roadrunner-bridge) package.

> **Note**
> Read more about `spiral/roadrunner-bridge` package installation and
> configuration [here](../framework/application-server.md)

Register the Bootloader `Spiral\RoadRunnerBridge\Bootloader\CentrifugoBootloader` in your application.

After installing the package, you need to add the bootloader from the package to your application.

```php
protected const LOAD = [
    // ...
    \Spiral\RoadRunnerBridge\Bootloader\CentrifugoBootloader::class,
    // ...
];
```

## Configuration

### RoadRunner server

To configure the communication between RoadRunner and Centrifugo, you will need to modify the `.rr.yaml` file.

```yaml
version: '2.7'

rpc:
  listen: tcp://0.0.0.0:6001

server:
  command: "php app.php"
  relay: pipes

centrifuge:
  proxy_address: "tcp://0.0.0.0:10001" <==== RoadRunner Centrifuge plugin address
  grpc_api_address: "centrifugo:10000" <==== Centrifuge server address
```

> **Note**
> Read more about the configuration of the Centrifuge plugin [here](https://roadrunner.dev/docs/plugins-centrifuge).

### Centrifugo server

To complete the integration, you will need to configure the Centrifugo server by creating a `config.json` file and
specifying the communication settings between Centrifugo and RoadRunner.

**Here is an example `config.json` file that shows how to configure the communication between servers**

```json
{
  // ...
  "allowed_origins": [
    "*"
  ],
  "publish": true,
  "proxy_publish": true,
  "proxy_subscribe": true,
  "proxy_connect": true,
  "allow_subscribe_for_client": true,
  "grpc_api": true,
  "grpc_api_address": "0.0.0.0",
  "grpc_api_port": 10000,
  "proxy_connect_endpoint": "grpc://127.0.0.1:10001",
  "proxy_connect_timeout": "10s",
  "proxy_publish_endpoint": "grpc://127.0.0.1:10001",
  "proxy_publish_timeout": "10s",
  "proxy_subscribe_endpoint": "grpc://127.0.0.1:10001",
  "proxy_subscribe_timeout": "10s",
  "proxy_refresh_endpoint": "grpc://127.0.0.1c:10001",
  "proxy_refresh_timeout": "10s",
  "proxy_rpc_endpoint": "grpc://127.0.0.1:10001",
  "proxy_rpc_timeout": "10s"
}
```

> **Note**
> More information about Centrifugo server configuration you can read on the
> official [documentation](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/configuration)

**In this configuration**

- `proxy_connect_endpoint` - RoadRunner server address, which will handle the
  new [connection events](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#connect-proxy)
- `proxy_publish_endpoint` - RoadRunner server address, which will handle
  the [publish events](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#publish-proxy)
- `proxy_subscribe_endpoint` - RoadRunner server address, which will handle
  the [subscribe events](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#subscribe-proxy)
- `proxy_refresh_endpoint` - RoadRunner server address, which will handle
  the [refresh events](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#refresh-proxy)
- `proxy_rpc_endpoint` - RoadRunner server address, which will handle
  the [rpc events](https://centrifugal.dev/docs/server/proxy#rpc-proxy)

Centrifugo allows you to use multiple RoadRunner servers to handle different types of events. This can be useful in
situations where you want to scale up the number of events that your application can handle or where you want to improve
the reliability of the communication between Centrifugo and RoadRunner.

To use multiple, you will need to specify the addresses of the servers in the `config.json` file. For example, you might
configure one RoadRunner server to handle connection events and another to handle RPC calls, as shown in the following
example configuration:

```json
{
  // ...
  "proxy_connect_endpoint": "grpc://127.0.0.1:10001",
  "proxy_connect_timeout": "10s",
  "proxy_rpc_endpoint": "grpc://127.0.0.1:10002",
  "proxy_rpc_timeout": "10s"
}
```

You can use this approach to distribute the workload among multiple RoadRunner servers, depending on your needs.

> **Note**
> Keep in mind that using multiple RoadRunner servers will require additional configuration and setup, and you will need
> to ensure that the servers are properly coordinated to ensure smooth operation. However, the benefits of increased
> scalability and reliability can be well worth the effort.

### Spiral Framework application

To use the Centrifuge in your application, you will need to create a `centrifugo.php` file in
the `app/config` directory. In this file, you can specify **services** that will handle incoming events from
the Centrifugo server, as well as any interceptors that should be applied to the events.

Here is an example of a `centrifugo.php` config file that shows how to specify services and interceptors:

```php
<?php

declare(strict_types=1);

use RoadRunner\Centrifugo\Request\RequestType;

return [
    'services' => [
        RequestType::Connect->value => ConnectService::class,
        RequestType::Subscribe->value => SubscribeService::class,
        RequestType::Refresh->value => RefreshService::class,
        RequestType::Publish->value => PublishService::class,
        RequestType::RPC->value => RPCService::class,
    ],
    'interceptors' => [
        RequestType::Connect->value => [
            Interceptor\AuthInterceptor::class,
        ],
        RequestType::Subscribe->value => [
            Interceptor\AuthInterceptor::class,
        ],
        RequestType::RPC->value => [
            Interceptor\AuthInterceptor::class,
        ],
        '*' => [
            Interceptor\TelemetryInterceptor::class,
        ],
    ],
];
```

> **Note**
> For more information on event handlers (**services**) and how to use them in a Spiral application, you can refer to
> the documentation section on [Event Handlers](./services.md). This page provides additional details and examples to
> help you get started with event handling.

### Javascript client

You can use the official [JavaScript SDK](https://github.com/centrifugal/centrifuge-js) for Centrifugo to facilitate
communication between the Centrifugo server and the client browser in your application. It provides a set of APIs that
allow you to connect to the Centrifugo server, subscribe to channels, and receive messages in real-time.

Using the JavaScript SDK, you can establish a WebSocket connection between the client and the Centrifugo server, and all
communication between RoadRunner and the client will be routed through the Centrifugo server. This means that you don't
need to open any additional ports on your server to support real-time communication between the client and the server.

## Example Application

There is a good example [Demo ticket booking system](https://github.com/spiral/ticket-booking) application built on the
Spiral Framework, which is a high-performance PHP framework that follows the principles of microservices and allows
developers to create reusable, independent, and easy-to-maintain components.

It demonstrates how to use RoadRunner's Centrifuge plugin to enable real-time communication between the Centrifugo
server and the client browser.
